  "description": "The Addressable Asset System allows the developer to ask for an asset via its address. Once an asset (e.g. a prefab) is marked \"addressable\", it generates an address which can be called from anywhere. Wherever the asset resides (local or remote), the system will locate it and its dependencies, then return it.\n\nUse 'Window->Asset Management->Addressables' to begin working with the system.\n\nAddressables use asynchronous loading to support loading from any location with any collection of dependencies. Whether you have been using direct references, traditional asset bundles, or Resource folders, addressables provide a simpler way to make your game more dynamic. Addressables simultaneously opens up the world of asset bundles while managing all the complexity.\n\nFor usage samples, see github.com/Unity-Technologies/Addressables-Sample",

    "changelog": "- Fixed an issue where scene InternalId collisions were very likely when using dynamic internal asset naming\n- Fixed catalogs to use back slashes rather than forward slashes for android builds.\n- Fixed an issue where \"Failed to remove scene from Addressables profiler\" warning occurs when a scene is unloaded.\n- Prevent a KeyNotFoundException from being logged to the console.\n- Fix error message to report not found when loading non-Addressable asset by guid\n- Fixed issue where a NullReferenceException occurs when using WaitForCompletion and the max number of concurrent requests is set to 1.\n- Fixed issue where there is missing asset data in the Addressables Profiler for binary catalogs.\n- Added note about the limitations of the Check for Content Update Restrictions tool.\n- Add migration upgrade prompt for legacy path pairs (ex. RemoteLoadPath)\n- Fixed an issue where a broken script on any Addressable Asset would make it impossible to select Addressable Assets in the AssetReference inspector\n- Add logging of catalog and asset bundle http operations.\n- Add UI to trigger CCD management API http call logging (requires newer CCD package)\n- CCD Automatic Profiles can now be one per-profile, rather than one per AddressableSettings instance\n- CCD Manager is built when using the Build to CCD and the standard Build content menu\n- Add support for CCD Management SDK 3.0"
