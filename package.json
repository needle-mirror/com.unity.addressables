  "description": "The Addressable Asset System allows the developer to ask for an asset via its address. Once an asset (e.g. a prefab) is marked \"addressable\", it generates an address which can be called from anywhere. Wherever the asset resides (local or remote), the system will locate it and its dependencies, then return it.\n\nUse 'Window->Asset Management->Addressables' to begin working with the system.\n\nAddressables use asynchronous loading to support loading from any location with any collection of dependencies. Whether you have been using direct references, traditional asset bundles, or Resource folders, addressables provide a simpler way to make your game more dynamic. Addressables simultaneously opens up the world of asset bundles while managing all the complexity.\n\nFor usage samples, see github.com/Unity-Technologies/Addressables-Sample",

    "changelog": "- The group edit window saves sort order and enabled columns. Groups are not sorted but can be reordered by dragging and dropping and that state is saved. This ordering has been moved to the Addressables data folder into the file AddressableAssetGroupSortSettings. This file can be added to .gitignore for per user sorting, or can be checked into version control for team sorting.\n- Fix \"IndexOutOfRangeException\" console message when assigning an addressable SpriteAtlas to an AssetReferenceSprite.\n- Make SubObjectGUID an Editor only field. It would not work properly at Runtime due to the lack of AssetDatabase, but this makes it explicit at compile time.\n- Switch the Runtime key to never use the SubObjectGUID and always use SubObjectName for subobjects.\n- CheckCatalogUpdate now returns 1 when there is an update available.\n- CanBuildPlayer has been switched to using the Bee postprocessor and should return better error messages on failure."
