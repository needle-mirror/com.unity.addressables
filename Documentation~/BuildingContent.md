# Create a build

When you use the Addressables package, you can build your content (AssetBundles) as a separate step from your application player. The Addressables package provides its own build scripts for this purpose, accessible from the toolbar of the [Groups window](GroupsWindow.md). 

You can build your Addressables content as part of the Player build, or you can build them as separate steps.

You can also perform a [full build](builds-full-build.md) or an [update build](builds-update-build.md).
