# Addressables Script Reference

This section of the documentation contains details of the scripting API that Unity provides for the Addressables package. 

The scripting reference is organised according to the classes available to scripts which are described along with their methods, properties and any other information relevant to their use.

API are grouped by namespaces they belong to, and can be selected from the sidebar to the left. You can use the Filter control above the sidebar to filter the table of contents so that it only shows entries containing the string you enter. You can also use the Search control at the top of the window to perform a full-text search of the Addressables documentation.
