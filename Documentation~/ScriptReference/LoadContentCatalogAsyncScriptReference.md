# LoadContentCatalogAsync

Write a description of the API here.  Give some explanation of what it is, some possible use cases, pitfalls, whatever.  Just go into more detail here than the xml docs.  We want to be more useful than the tooltip of a mouse hover.

This cs file should be created.  To reference different code examples in the same file, add a region tag using # and then the region name.  So, for example, if I were wanting to reference a method in the file called DoSomething, the string below would look like
`../../Tests/Editor/DocExampleCode/ScriptReference/UsingLoadContentCatalogAsync.cs#DoSomething`
and in the cs file, there would be a #region DoSomething setup.

[!code-cs[sample](../../Tests/Editor/DocExampleCode/ScriptReference/UsingLoadContentCatalogAsync.cs)]

Feel free to add more code samples here if there are other useful scenario.
If there are opinionated workflows you'd like to encourage, you can do so here as well.
