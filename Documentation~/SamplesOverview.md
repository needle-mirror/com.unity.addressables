# Addressables samples

The Addressables package contains samples that you can download into your project. To access the samples go to **Window** > **Package Manager** > **Addressables**.

These samples include examples on how to disable asset importing during a build, creating custom build and Play mode scripts, and providing an `AddressableUtility` class.

When you download and import a sample, it's placed inside the `Assets/Samples/Addressables/{AddressablesVersionNumber}` path of your project.

|**Sample**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Addressables Utility**|Contains a set of utility functions for Addressables. The script contains a static method `GetAddressFromAssetReference` which provides the Addressable address used to reference a given `AssetRefence` internally.|
|**ComponentReference**|Creates an AssetReference that's restricted to having a specific component. For more information see the ComponentReference sample project located in the [Addressables Samples](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Addressables-Sample) repository.|
|**Custom Build and Playmode Scripts**|Includes two [custom scripts](xref:addressables-api-build-player-content):<br/><br/>- A custom Play mode script located in `Editor/CustomPlayModeScript.cs` of the sample. This script works similarly to the Use Existing Build (requires built groups) play mode script already included. The methods added to accomplish this are `CreateCurrentSceneOnlyBuildSetup` and `RevertCurrentSceneSetup` on the `CustomBuildScript`.<br/>- A custom build script located in `Editor/CustomBuildScript.cs` of the sample. This custom build script creates a build that only includes the currently open scene. A bootstrap scene is automatically created and a script is added that loads the built scene on startup.<br/><br/>For these examples, the build and load paths used by default are `[UnityEngine.AddressableAssets.Addressables.BuildPath]/[BuildTarget]` and `{UnityEngine.AddressableAssets.Addressables.RuntimePath}/[BuildTarget]` respectively.<br/><br/>The `ScriptableObject` of the class has already been created, but you can use the Create menu to make another `ScriptableObject`. For this `CustomPlayModeScript` the create menu path is **Addressables > Content Builders > Use CustomPlayMode Script**. By default, this creates a CustomPlayMode.asset ScriptableObject. The same goes for the `CustomBuildScript`.|
|**Disable Asset Import on Build**|Provides a script that disables asset importing during a player build. This improves build performance because `AssetBundles` are copied into StreamingAssets at build time.  This sample is only relevant for Editor versions below 2021.2. In 2021.2+, the Editor provides the ability to include folders outside of `Assets/` into `StreamingAssets`.<br/><br/>When the sample is imported into the project, a player build without asset importing can be triggered by the new menu item **Build/Disabled Importer Build**. The build output is placed into `DisabledImporterBuildPath/{EditorUserBuildSettings.activeBuildTarget}/` by default. The sample class `DisableAssetImportOnBuild` can be edited to alter the build path.|
|**Import Existing Group**|Contains a tool that imports group assets, for example from a custom package, to the current project.<br/><br/>The tool is located under `Window/Asset Management/Addressables/Import Groups`. The window requires a path to the `AddressableAssetGroup.asset` scriptable object, a name for the group, and a folder for any schemas related to the imported `AddressableAssetGroup`.|
|**Prefab Spawner**|Provides a basic script that instantiates and destroys a prefab `AssetReference`. To use the sample, attach the provided script, `PrefabSpawnerSample`, to a `GameObject` in your scene. Assign an `AdressableAsset` to the `AssetReference` field of that script. If you're using the `Use Existing Build` playmode script, ensure that your Addressable content is built. Then, enter Play mode.|
