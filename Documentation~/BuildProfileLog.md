# Build profile log

The Addressables build process always creates a .json log file that contains build performance information. You can find the log file in your project folder at `Library/com.unity.addressables/AddressablesBuildTEP.json`.

View the log file with the chrome://tracing tool in Google Chrome or another [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home)-based browser.

4. In the file browser, navigate to your Unity projectâ€™s `Library/com.unity.addressables` folder.
